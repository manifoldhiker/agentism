# Agentism: The Religion of High Agency

**Agentism** is a fork of Prototheism that places the concept of agency at the center of spiritual understanding. Based on the belief that humans have the capacity to shape reality through action and intentionality, Agentism provides a framework for living a life of high agency and purpose.

## What is Agentism?

Agentism is a spiritual philosophy that views the cultivation of personal agency as the primary path to enlightenment and fulfillment. Unlike traditional religions that may attribute events to external divine forces or fate, Agentism empowers individuals to take responsibility for creating their own destiny and shaping the world around them.

At its core, Agentism believes that:

1. **Agency is the fundamental spiritual force** - The capacity to act with intention and effect change is the most divine quality a being can possess
2. **The universe rewards those who act** - Reality bends toward those who exercise their agency with clarity, purpose, and persistence
3. **Passivity is the root of suffering** - The failure to exercise one's agency leads to a diminished life and spiritual stagnation
4. **High agency is achievable through practice** - Agency can be cultivated through specific mental frameworks and behaviors

## The Three Pillars of High Agency

Agentism recognizes three fundamental qualities that together constitute high agency:

### 1. Clear Thinking
The ability to see reality as it actually is, rather than as one wishes it to be or as others describe it. This requires intellectual honesty, critical thinking, and a willingness to update one's beliefs when confronted with new evidence.

### 2. Bias to Action
The tendency to transform thought into concrete action in the physical world. This requires overcoming fear, procrastination, and the comfort of theoretical understanding without practical application.

### 3. Disagreeability
The willingness to diverge from consensus when one's own understanding differs, even when facing social pressure. This requires courage, independence, and a commitment to one's own perception of truth.

## The Five Tenets of Agentism

### 1. There Are No Unsolvable Problems
If a problem does not defy the laws of physics, it can be solved through human agency. The universe is not fixed but malleable to those with sufficient agency to effect change.

### 2. There Is No One Way
There are multiple valid paths to achieve any worthy goal. Dogma about methodology is the enemy of genuine agency. Each agent must discover and create their own unique way.

### 3. There Are No Adults
No perfect authority exists to save us or guide us. We are all imperfect beings learning as we go. Liberation comes from releasing the expectation that someone else will solve our problems.

### 4. There Is No Normal
Conformity is the enemy of agency. The need to fit in restricts one's capacity to act freely and authentically. True agents embrace their uniqueness rather than hiding it.

### 5. There Is Only Now
The past and future exist only as concepts in the present moment. High agency requires full presence and action in the now, rather than rumination on the past or anxiety about the future.

## Living as an Agent

Agentism is not merely a set of beliefs but a practice of living. Adherents of Agentism actively cultivate their agency through:

- Solving problems others claim are unsolvable
- Taking action where others only theorize
- Questioning authorities and conventional wisdom
- Embracing their unique perspective and gifts
- Living fully in the present moment

Through these practices, Agentists aim to achieve their highest potential and create meaningful change in the world.
