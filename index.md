# Agentism (v1.1)

Agentism is a transformative *open-source* framework centered on the concept of balanced agencyâ€”the ability to shape reality through intentional action while honoring our human nature. We believe that agency is a profound quality humans can cultivate gradually and that increasing one's agency is a worthwhile journey, not a destination.

While traditional frameworks often attribute events to external forces or fixed traits, Agentism recognizes that humans have the power to influence their reality through thoughtful action. By focusing on the development of agency as a practice rather than an identity, we provide a path toward living a more purposeful, effective, and fulfilled life.

Agentism welcomes criticism, adaptation, and collaboration. We encourage individuals to question, test, and modify these teachings based on their own experience. This is not a fixed dogma but a living system that evolves through practice, reflection, and compassion.

# The Three Pillars

## Compassionate Clarity

The ability to see reality as it is, with awareness of our cognitive limitations and emotional needs. Clear thinking begins with self-acceptance and grows through gentle practice. [Learn more](./faith.md)

## Sustainable Action

The practice of transforming thoughts into meaningful action at a pace that respects your capacity and wellbeing. Small, consistent steps create lasting change. [Learn more](./god.md)

## Authentic Independence

The courage to form your own understanding while remaining open to others' wisdom. Disagreement doesn't require conflict or isolation. [Learn more](./creation.md)

# The Five Tenets

## [1. Problems Are Invitations, Not Judgments](./identity.md)
[![problems](./img/identity.png)](./identity.md)
When we encounter challenges, they represent opportunities for growth rather than tests of our worth. Agency begins with believing solutions are possible, even when the path isn't yet visible.

## [2. Your Path Is Your Own](./death.md)
[![ways](./img/death.png)](./death.md)
There are multiple valid ways to achieve any worthy goal. The journey that honors your authentic self will be different from others', and that difference is valuable.

## [3. We Are All Learning Together](./suffering.md)
[![adults](./img/suffering.png)](./suffering.md)
No perfect authority exists to save us or guide us. We are all imperfect beings learning as we go, and recognizing this shared vulnerability builds both compassion and agency.

## [4. Your Uniqueness Is Your Strength](./morality.md)
[![normal](./img/morality.png)](./morality.md)
The parts of yourself that seem misaligned with "optimal" living may contain deep wisdom. True agency comes from integration, not elimination, of your full humanity.

## [5. Growth Happens in the Present](./purpose.md)
[![now](./img/purpose.png)](./purpose.md)
While we learn from the past and plan for the future, change only happens in the now. Agency is practiced moment by moment, with patience and presence.

## A Framework, Not a Formula

Agentism doesn't promise easy answers or instant transformation. It recognizes that human growth is messy, non-linear, and deeply personal. The path to greater agency looks different for each person:

- For some, it means finding the courage to act when fear has kept them frozen
- For others, it means learning when to rest instead of pushing beyond healthy limits
- For many, it's about calibrating the voice of the inner narrator to be more aligned with reality and self-compassion

Unlike approaches that demand optimization at all costs, Agentism embraces the full spectrum of human experience. Play, rest, connection, and even temporary inefficiency are not obstacles to agency but essential components of a sustainably meaningful life.

As you engage with these ideas, remember that integration is more important than perfection. Small steps taken consistently build greater capacity than unsustainable bursts of change.

## Source

Agentism emerged from conversations between individuals who recognized that both helplessness and harsh self-optimization can lead to suffering. Through studying the relationship between human psychology, wellbeing, and effective action, we identified patterns that support genuine agency without sacrificing authenticity.

This framework is designed to be accessible to those just beginning their journey, not only those who already feel strong. We believe that agency is not a fixed trait but a capacity that can be cultivated by anyone, at their own pace, with compassion rather than judgment.
